# hello-world
This is my intro to repositories
My name is Taylor and I am a freshman at UM. I value humor and compassion. The most important people in my life are my mom, my sister, my friends at UM (meredith, lydia, megan) and my other old high school friends (sam, nathaniel, kelley) and my boyfriend adham.
